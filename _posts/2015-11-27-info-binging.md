Why should we read the latest Buzzfeed clickbait rather than in-depth longform journalism? Why do we use Facebook so much?

Ask the heaviest smartphone user you know, and they'll admit to using too much technology. We know screentime is bad, but the [attention economy](http://www.tristanharris.com/essays/) incentivizes our novelty-induced dopamine rushes.

I'm trying to reduce information overload. Here are some methods I've been using for the past while.

I would love to hear your thoughts on benefits, pitfalls, and other ideas: email me at [j@jaan.io](mailto:j@jaan.io) and I’ll keep this updated.

Here’s the current list:

* Not reading any news except for the Harper’s [Weekly Review](http://harpers.org/blog/category/weekly-review/) email every Tuesday.
* Having two laptops: a ‘work’ laptop with email and distracting sites blocked, and an ‘email/distraction’ device (right now these are a Macbook Air and cheap netbook).
* On the coding and work laptop, using the [SelfControl app](https://selfcontrolapp.com/) to keep Gmail and any distracting sites blocked for 30 days at a time (you need to run an extra command to [extend the maximum block length](https://github.com/SelfControlApp/selfcontrol/wiki/Tweaking-Max-Block-Length-and-Block-Length-Interval)).
* A habit of looking at my [Rescuetime](http://rescuetime.com/) logs every week and updating my SelfControl blacklist with distracting websites.
* For work-related communication Hipchat, Slack, and Google Hangouts chat are a good replacement given that I can't access email on my main laptop.
* In Gmail, using lots of custom filters for labels such as "00.MustRead", "01.Someday". Sending all mailing lists I need to read to 00, and articles of interest or things I need to reply to 'eventually' to 01.
* Follow [MacBreakz](http://www.publicspace.net/MacBreakZ/)’ break system of 5 minutes every 50 minutes. Doing pushups, pullups, squats, and planks during the break.
* Using [Adblock](https://adblockplus.org/) and [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/) on all devices to block ads, Google Analytics, and JavaScript.
* Every few months: skimming the top 20 posts of each day on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/) using the [HckrNews](http://hckrnews.com/) interface. Save interesting links to bookmarks / Instapaper for reading in the next few months. Doing this in batch mode is helpful for filtering useful things from hype cycle fare.
* Once a year: skim RSS feeds using Feedly, save to Instapaper. I like [Longform](http://longform.org/)’s curation service of high quality long-form journalism and essays.
* Many tricks from ‘[This is your brain on mobile](https://medium.com/@jgvandehey/this-is-your-brain-on-mobile-15308056cfae)’ such as turning off all phone notifications and having no social media apps installed.
* Using a pay-as-you-go [phone plan](https://www.ptel.com/). Combined with Google Voice, this is cheap and the 10c/MB data keeps me off mobile internet unless when it's necessary (like maps when out).
* On Facebook, systematically unfollowing *everyone* in my newsfeed (this took an hour of clicking, but was [well worth it](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-facebook-makes-us-unhappy)). My newsfeed is empty apart from ‘People you may know’ and ‘Birthdays Today’. Back when I didn’t have it blocked on the email laptop, I used the [Kill Newsfeed](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kill-news-feed/hjobfcedfgohjkaieocljfcppjbkglfd?hl=en) extension. This is revelatory: if I'm truly interested in someone's life updates, I'll go to their profile page and read their updates, or use the graph search tool.
* Leaving all devices at work as often as possible. This means I’m fully disconnected at home and forced to read, [be alone](http://chronicle.com/article/The-End-of-Solitude/3708), do things, and [take a real break](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/opinion/sunday/hit-the-reset-button-in-your-brain.html).
* For new music, the [Hype Machine](http://hypem.com/lyfos). For classics, [Spotify](https://play.spotify.com/user/lyfos/).
* For complete blocking of ambient noise, 3M Peltor [industrial earmuffs](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009LI4K/) over in-ear [headphones](http://www.amazon.com/RBH-EP-2-Earphones/dp/B00H7LAJQA) give the most reduction I’ve found even in a crowded NYC subway.
* Tara Brach’s [guided meditations](http://www.tarabrach.com/audioarchives-guided-meditations.html) and podcasts are awesome for [downtime](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mental-downtime/) and self-therapy during the week.

# Benefits and pitfalls

Because email is blocked on my main laptop, if I get distracted I either have to browse very lame sites (the interesting distracting ones are blocked). I can’t New Tab away from boredom or sitting with the discomfort of doing whatever I'm stuck with or have fear-of-failure of.

I’m slowly getting better at sitting with this existential crisis of ‘I’m stuck on this problem’ longer and longer. It is uncomfortable, but paying attention to the discomfort helps.  If I sit through the mental angst longer than is comfortable, it dissipates and interesting ideas come up. This doesn't happen if I'm constantly checking emails or phone notifications.

Severely limiting my information intake means I read more books and long form journalism. My knowledge about big events is sometimes delayed, then gleaned through someone surprised that I haven’t heard about the latest terrorist attack instantaneously. This humanizes the information, and I get to listen the story then read about it later.

How could information filtering be applied to the physical world, and is this necessary? For example, I’d love to see the collections at the Met, MoMA, and other NYC museums, but there is no time. Museum collections and physical things do not have a ‘save for later’ feature. There is no equivalent of Adblock for the real world yet (augmented reality should fix this). But can we train ourselves to not look at advertising?

If everyone followed these workflows, no one would make money online and there would be no one to upvote things on Hacker News or Reddit, and no one to ‘like’ things on Facebook. These techniques might leave me more (or less) susceptible to [filter bubbles](http://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles) but it’s a fun experiment.
