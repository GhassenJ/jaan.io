# Extensions

I'd love to see this applied to entire ablums, to potentially map out similar and different elements of the tracks and how they fit into the album as a whole. Do this for sigur ros! color labels = individual tracks!

Source separation could be used to get a cleaner signal and further differentiate clusters on the plots. 

**Thanks to [Gordon Burman]() and [Andrew Hartnet]() for introducing me to t-SNE and many helpful discussions.** -->
